# ChatDB

## Overview

ChatDB is an interactive ChatGPT-like application designed to assist users in learning how to query data in various database systems, including SQL and NoSQL databases. Unlike traditional chatbots, ChatDB can not only suggest sample queries and understand natural language queries but also execute these queries directly in the database systems and display the results to the users.

## Features

- **Natural Language Query Understanding**: ChatDB can understand and process queries written in natural language, making it easier for users to interact with the system.
- **Sample Query Suggestions**: The application can suggest sample queries, including those that use specific language constructs (e.g., `GROUP BY` in SQL).
- **Database Query Execution**: ChatDB can execute queries in both SQL and NoSQL databases and display the results directly to the user.
- **Interactive Learning**: Users can learn how to query databases interactively, with ChatDB providing feedback and results in real-time.
